  Overview and reference for building CHT applications
---

To create a digital health tool using the Community Health Toolkit: build a CHT Application or re-use an existing CHT Application. The [CHT Core Framework]({{ ref="core" }}) provides a foundation on which many digital health tools can be conceptualised and built. A CHT Application takes that foundation and builds on it to create a concrete digital health tool tailored to the health workflows in a targeted community. 

Since all CHT Applications share the same foundation, they also share capabilities and attributes. For example, all CHT Applications share a similar user-interface and share the same look-and-feel. All CHT Applications can be built to scale, can run across a variety of hardware, support offline-first experiences, and support most languages. These baseline capabilities are universal across all CHT Applications. Learn more about this in [Why the CHT?]({{ ref="why-the-cht" }})

Although CHT Applications share this common foundation, they can be built to tackle the diverse health challenges of communities around the globe. Some examples of health interventions which have been digitized by CHT applications include antenatal care, postnatal care, integrated community case management, family planning, malnutrition, immunization, and epidemic response. 

This section provides an introduction to CHT Applications, provides some sample CHT Applications, and provides reference materials for those wanting to build a new app or deploy an existing app.
