  Overview and reference for building CHT applications
---

To create a digital health tool using the Community Health Toolkit - you'll want to build a CHT Application or re-use an existing CHT Application. The [CHT Core Framework]({{ ref="core" }}) provides a foundation on which many digital health tools can be conceptualised and built. A CHT Application takes that foundation and extends it to become a concrete digital health tool, digitizing the health workflows of a specific targeted community. 

Since all CHT Applications share the same foundation, they also share capabilities and attributes. For example, all CHT Applications share a similar user-interface and share the same look-and-feel. All CHT Applications can be built to scale, can run across a variety of hardware, support offline-first experiences, and support most languages. These baseline capabilities are universal across all CHT Applications. Learn more about this in [Why the CHT?]({{ ref="why-the-cht" }})

Although CHT Applications share the same foundation, their configurable nature allows them great diversity. Some examples of health interventions which have been digitized by CHT applications include antenatal care, postnatal care, integrated community case management, family planning, malnutrition, immunization, and epidemic response. 

This section provides an introduction to CHT Applications, provides some example CHT Applications, and provides reference materials for those wanting to build or adapt a CHT Application.
