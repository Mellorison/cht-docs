Applications built with the CHT are configurable by design, and support an exceptional range of features and health service areas. The ANC Reference App provides you with a template for structuring and organizing their digital health app, itâ€™s configuration code, and its testing framework. It includes a foundation for forms related to pregnancy and delivery, flexible data fields, and analytics, and can be deployed as-is or customized by a developer for your unique context. 

To install the ANC Reference Application, follow the [easy installation instructions](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/blob/master/INSTALL.md). An [overview of the ANC Reference App](anc-reference-app-overview.pdf) and its key features is also available.
