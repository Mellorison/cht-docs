This action requires two files in the folder you are going to execute this command from. The files are `forms-on-google-drive.json` and  `.gdrive.secrets.json`. 



## forms-on-google-drive.json 

This file should be a json file with a key value pair. The key being the folder/name of the doc when it gets saved locally. The value being the ID from the document saved in google drive. 

To get the ID for the form. Open the form in google sheets. The URL will look like this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12345ABCDEF/edit#gid=1820319148 . The ID is the middle portion `12345ABCDEF`

```json
{
  "app/sample_report.xlsx": "12345ABCDEF",
  "contact/person-create.xlsx": "ABCDEF123456",
}
```

## .gdrive.secrets.json

This file contains authentication secrets that are generated by enabling access to your drive using these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth)



```json
{
		"client_id": "your_client_id",
		"project_id": "your_project_id",
		"auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
		"token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
		"auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
		"client_secret": "your_client_secret",
		"redirect_uris": ["your_redirect_uris", "http://localhost"]
}
```

## Run the Medic Conf Action

With the files in place. Run `medic-conf fetch-forms-from-google-drive`

Medic-conf will then prompt for an access code from your authenticated user. Follow the prompts through google's authentication and copy the access code into your command line. The forms will then be copied to the forms folder in the directory you are executing from. 

*Note: If the browser does not launch own its own. Copy the URL and paste the authentication url into a browser and then follow the prompts.*
