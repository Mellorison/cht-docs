{{% pageinfo %}}**Goals**
- Understand the existing situation, who is participating in it, what matters to them, and and their resources and constraints.  Produce a sketch to reflect the reality of the current system.
- With these insights, identify opportunities for improvements to the current system and appropriately select a use case, workflow, and technology tool that can be integrated and sustained.

## Current State and System Goals

What’s the summary of the current situation?

What are the goals of the new system that will guide design and iteration?

What problems will digital tools solve in the new system? What gaps will they address?

Can we quickly sketch the current system? Who will do what, where, and when? 

Can we quickly sketch the new system we are building? Who will do what, where, and when? 

## People Involved

Which of the following roles will interact with the digital system?

- Patients
- Household caregivers
- Community Health Workers
- CHW Supervisors
- Nurses
- Clinicians
- Health facility administrators
- Other health facility staff
- Other management staff

How will each of these roles interact with the system? 

Why will those involved (i.e. users) prioritize this initiative? 

What is the organizational hierarchy? 

What are the relevant management, patient, and catchment ratios or numbers? 

What are the permissions and data access hierarchies? 

Who are the other key stakeholders, e.g. family members, local leaders?


## Workflows

What will change in key actors (users’) daily workflows? 

Are any new workflows reasonable and likely given their context? 

Will the new workflows require training? 

Are there feasibility considerations, e.g. power, language, tech familiarity?

How do the key actors interact now, and how will they interact within the new system? e.g. daily or monthly or ad hoc meetings, management workflows, communication practices.


## Context

Is there anything unique about the context that is likely to affect the end-to-end system? Examples include security, connectivity, supply chain, and political context. 

## Data Usage and Indicators

What is the quick summary of how data will be used at each level of the system? 

Are integrations needed with national HMIS? Upfront or after launch of the system?

What are the intended effects of the system? 
e.g. improve # of cases detected and speed of detection, or quality, equity, coverage of care

How will we know the system is working as expected? i.e. daily and weekly activity indicators

How will we know the system is having its intended effects? i.e. intermediate impact indicators

Are there any other key indicators that you have prioritized for these use cases? If so, please share and include any relevant numerators and denominators.
