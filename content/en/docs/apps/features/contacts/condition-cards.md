Each condition card is defined as a card object in the `cards` array of `contact-summary.templated.js`. The properties for each object determine how and when the card and its fields are shown.

<!-- If you change the field data in this table, update the duplicate descriptions in ### Fields -->
{{% show-reference contact-cards %}}
