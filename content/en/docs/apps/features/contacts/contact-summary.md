  Defining the fields shown in the contact's Summary card
---
 
Each field that can be shown on a contact's profile is defined as an object in the `fields` array of `contact-summary.templated.js`. The properties for each object determine how and when the field is shown.

<!-- If you change this table, update the duplicate descriptions in ### Cards -->
{{% show-reference contact-summary %}}
 
See [How to configure profile pages]() for an example.
