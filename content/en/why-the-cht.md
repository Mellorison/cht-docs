The [Community Health Toolkit](https://communityhealthtoolkit.org) is a collection of open-source technologies and open-access resources developed by a community focused on global health equity. We envision a world where primary health care is equitable, accessible, and delivered by people who are trusted in their communities. Start with the [CHT overview]({{< ref apps >}}), and join our [community forum](https://forum.communityhealthtoolkit.org/)!

Community health systems can dramatically improve the accessibility, quality, speed, and equity of primary health care, but only if health workers are effectively equipped and supported. Advances in open source technology are making it easier and more affordable than ever to deliver impactful, dignified care in even the hardest-to-reach communities. 

With more than 27,000 health workers using these tools to support a million home visits every month, the CHT is the most full-featured, mature, and widely-used open source software toolkit designed specifically for community health systems. Hundreds of individuals contribute to the CHT as designers, developers, researchers, health policy experts, health system implementers, and frontline health workers. For more about the unique strengths of our open source community and the technology we’re building together, see [Why the CHT]()?

## The CHT Community

The CHT is a free and open source public good, being co-designed by a diverse range of global health NGOs, technical organizations, governments, and research institutions, with the non-profit organization Medic Mobile serving as a technical steward. Hundreds of individuals contribute to the CHT as designers, developers, researchers, health policy experts, health system implementers, and frontline health workers.

## Building Apps With the CHT Core Framework

The Core Framework makes it faster to build full-featured, scalable digital health apps by providing a foundation developers can build on. These apps can support most languages, are offline-first, and work on basic phones (via SMS), smartphones, tablets, and computers. 

App developers are able to define health system roles, permissions and reporting hierarchies, and make use of five highly configurable areas of functionality: messaging, task and schedule management, decision support workflows, longitudinal person profiles, and analytics. 

The Core Framework can be used to support the unique needs of a given health system and the work of community health workers, frontline supervisors, facility-based nurses, health system managers, and even patients and caregivers.

## Responsive Web App Model

A responsive web app is a hybrid of a website and a mobile application. On desktop and laptop computers, it runs in the web browser. On Android devices (such as cell phones or tablets), it is downloaded as an app. The same source code powers the experience, meaning that the app you see on your desktop is the same app you see on your mobile device. 

Web apps built with the Core Framework are fully responsive, which means content will scale to fill the available space. Users accessing the app on a mobile device will see a single-panel mobile layout. Users accessing the app on a desktop or laptop device will see a two-panel layout.

## Offline-First Technology

Digital health apps need to support health systems in a wide range of low infrastructure environments. Apps built with the Core Framework are designed to be offline-first and work with only an occasional internet connection.

These apps store a user’s data locally on their device so that workflows can be completed without syncing to the server. When a connection becomes available, data will automatically sync to and from the server. Offline-first technology enables health workers to carry out important duties even when opportunities to sync may be weeks apart. As with any app, there is a limit to how much data can be stored locally, particularly on a mobile device. For users needing access to large amounts of data, online user roles are available. 

## Made for Localization

Apps can be customized for different deployments and types of workflows. The Core Framework has been used in dozens of countries around the world with [localization settings]({{< ref "localization" >}}).

Users can currently interact with the app in English, French, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish, Swahili, or Indonesian and new languages can be added in the admin console. The app also supports Bikram Sambat or Gregorian calendars and localized date formatting.


## Reference Apps

The Community Health Toolkit’s Reference Apps provide organizations with a template for structuring and organizing a community health workflow, its configuration code, and testing framework. They include a foundation for forms, data fields, and even analytics, and can be deployed as-is or easily customized by a developer for your unique context.
